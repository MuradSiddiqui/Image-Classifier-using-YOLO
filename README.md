# Image-Classifier-using-YOLO
This project implements a real-time image classifier using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is renowned for its speed and accuracy in object detection, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time processing. Our classifier can detect and classify multiple object classes within images, providing a user-friendly interface.
